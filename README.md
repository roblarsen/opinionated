# Start here

Welcome to *opinionated*. Think of this as the opposite of HTML5 Boilerplate. Where HTML5 Boilerplate has strived present a set of smart, if minimalistic, defaults, appropriate for all levels of developers; *opinionated* will take the opposite approach. *opinionated* will push the decision tree as far as possible. When this project reaches maturity, it will present everything you need to get up and running to do enterprise class front end development without having to choose anything.
